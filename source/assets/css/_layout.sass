// Layout Rules
// http://smacss.com/book/type-layout
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page. However,
// there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major and minor
// components of a page. The minor components - such as a callout, or login
// form, or a navigation item - sit within the scope of major components such
// as a header or footer. We refer to minor components as Modules, whereas
// major components are referred to as Layout styles.
//
// Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on
// reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
// styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements
// that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors
// where appropriate.
